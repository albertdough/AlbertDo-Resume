        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Albert Do, a second-year student at UC Riverside currently studying History. I hope that I can use the knowledge I gain from majoring in History to help analyze law in different ways, similar to how historians look at history through different lenses in order to gain a better picture of previous times. With all the tools that historians use to look at History, I hope to bring those same skills and apply it to learning about the ins and outs of law. I am looking for an internship/job related to law so that I may gain some experience in the field.  <br><br>

        Akthough I have no prior experience with working for law firms, I have done an extensive amount of activities to prepare myself for my major. I visited the OC Heritage Museum and offered to volunteer during the Summer of 2019. There, I learned what it felt like to work at a place that safeguarded history for the sake of education. The people I worked with were some of the most devoted people to their job and were extremely helpful in helping me try to fit in. When it was time to open up the museum for the annual festival, I supervised the entrance and made sure everyone had a great and safe time. At the end of the day, after hours of cleaning up, I walked away with volunteer hours as well as a clearer mind; I knew that History was the major for me. Walking around every exhibit was like taking a time machine and traveling back to those times myself.<br><br>

        Law has always been an intriguing subject to me. The ability to win an argument through peaceful and legal terms was something that I always strived to work towards, especially with the people that I had problems with. My dad had always wanted to become a lawyer, but due to the fall of Saigon by the hands of the Viet Cong, he was forced to abandon that dream and come to America. I hope to continue his forgotten dream and become what he always wanted to be. I feel like there is a need to speak up for the people who cannot do so themselves. There are topics in the world that I am passionate about, and I hope that if I become a lawyer, I can help convince the people around me of my own views.
